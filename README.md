Hey there, I'm Juan JosÃ©, a Full-Stack Developer. Here, I'll upload the project with all the requirements. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!

First, you need to clone this theme into the directory where you keep your WordPress projects. Normally, it's located at:

ðŸ“‚ C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes\your-theme-folder-name

Then, you can upload it via your WordPress admin panel at http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin.
Go to Appearance > Themes, and simply upload the theme.

The Custom Post Type is working perfectly. If you have any questions, just ask!
